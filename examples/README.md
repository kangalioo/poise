Here is a curated list of examples that thrive to demonstrate the capabilities of `poise` and how its features are meant to be used.

To be able to run examples you must enable `serenity`'s `collector` feature. Thus if you want to run the `framework_usage` example, run: `cargo run --example=framework_usage --features collector`.

Do not that for the later example to run you must set teh following environement variables:
- `TOKEN` your application's token
- `APPLICATION_ID` the discord ID of your bot
- `OWNER_ID` your discord ID
